## What is Sadaqah Code?

Open-source initiative building Islamic technology infrastructure.

Tools that help Muslims practice their faith in the digital age — prayer reminders, Islamic calendars, focus modes, and more.

**Core principle:** Technology should serve Islamic values, not corporate profits.

### Why "Sadaqah Code"?

In Islam, **Sadaqah Jariyah** (ongoing charity) continues to benefit people long after the initial act.

Open-source software works the same way:
- Write code once → benefits Muslims forever
- Share knowledge → others build upon it
- Create tools → community improves them

**Code as continuous charity.**
